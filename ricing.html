title: Ricing guide
description: An introductory guide to smartphone ricing
---

<p><b>Ricing</b> is a term that refers to modifying the user interface of a device to pursue a certain aesthetic or provide tailored, perhaps missing functionality. This guide will focus on Android ricing, centering around user-friendly choices, and will avoid technical stuff like ROM flashing, rooting, bootloader unlocking, custom recovery and such.</p>

<p>Almost every piece of Android can be replaced with another that better fits the desired experience. This guide will try to teach you what components can be replaced (hint: anything if you try hard enough), what are the popular choices and how to modify them to fit your taste.</p>

<blockquote>
	"First of all; ricing wonâ€™t be an easy task. I mean, sure you can copy the config files from someone else and live with that. But that kind of ruins the fun of it all."

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>While every <small>(<b>every!</b>)</small> component of Android can be modified or replaced, some things require wildly different amounts of effort. <b>Focusing on easy modifications is recommended</b>, they provide a huge impact on aesthetic and functionality: modifying your launcher, choosing a nice background to tie everything together, changing some icons or adding some subtle animations.</p>

<p>If you <s>are a neet</s> have a lot of free time and dedication to customizing your entire Android experience, you can always flash a custom ROM, which provides <b>maximum</b> absolute fucking control over every aspect of your smartphone (security, privacy, performance, functionality, aesthetic, etc), but can be risky, void your warranty or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_(electronics)">brick</a> your device. Instructions vary wildly by device, ask <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Google</a> or <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/">XDA Forums</a> about it, it won't be covered here.</p>
