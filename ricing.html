title: Ricing guide
description: An introductory guide to smartphone ricing
---

<p><b>Ricing</b> is a term that refers to modifying the user interface of a device to pursue a certain aesthetic or provide tailored, perhaps missing functionality. This guide will focus on Android ricing, centering around user-friendly choices, and will avoid technical stuff like ROM flashing, rooting, bootloader unlocking, custom recovery and such.</p>

<p>Almost every piece of Android can be replaced with another that better fits the desired experience. This guide will try to teach you what components can be replaced (hint: anything if you try hard enough), what are the popular choices and how to modify them to fit your taste.</p>

<blockquote>
	"First of all; ricing wonâ€™t be an easy task. I mean, sure you can copy the config files from someone else and live with that. But that kind of ruins the fun of it all."

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>While every <small>(<b>every!</b>)</small> component of Android can be modified or replaced, some things require wildly different amounts of effort. <b>Focusing on easy modifications is recommended</b>, they provide a huge impact on aesthetic and functionality: modifying your launcher, choosing a nice background to tie everything together, changing some icons or adding some subtle animations.</p>

<p>If you <s>are a neet</s> have a lot of free time and dedication to customizing your entire Android experience, you can always flash a custom ROM, which provides <b>maximum</b> absolute fucking control over every aspect of your smartphone (security, privacy, performance, functionality, aesthetic, etc), but can be risky, void your warranty or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_(electronics)">brick</a> your device. Instructions vary wildly by device, ask <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Google</a> or <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/">XDA Forums</a> about it, it won't be covered here.</p>

<h3>Getting inspiration</h3>
<p>Before starting, you should have a rough idea of what it is that you're looking for. Maybe you just want to hide some apps or change a background, or maybe you'd like to have a <a href="/">fully custom homescreen</a>. Please do look at the <a href="https://boards.4chan.org/wg/homescreen">/wg/ thread</a> and <a href="/">the gallery over at the main page</a>.</p>

<h3>Replacing your launcher</h3>
<p>A <b>launcher</b> is an application that shows up whenever you press the Home button and it lets you open stuff -- its the <span title=":^)">home screen</span>. It offers a <i>desktop</i> with icons and a <i>drawer</i> where you navigate around a list of every installed application. It can also fit widgets, small panels which allow you to interact with an app without completely opening it (think looking at the current weather).</p>

<p>Most phones come with a launcher full of "useful" features like Google Now and icons which never appear consistent. Installing a new launcher will most likely deliver a great impact on your experience, since some can be fully customized (layouts, colors, animations) and most support custom icon packs. Chances are it'll also help your battery.</p>

<p>To replace your launcher, all you need to do is download one of your choice and set it as default after pressing the Home button. You don't need root or anything special.</p>

<p>The most popular choice on #homescreen and /g/ is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher">Nova Launcher</a>, a "highly customizable, performance driven, home screen replacement for Android" (<a href="http://novalauncher.com/">novalauncher.com</a>). While it is proprietary (and has a paid version), its highly recommended and more than enough to achieve a superior level of customization when compared to the stock Android launcher. It supports modifying the layouts (change desktop grid, switch between list or grid in drawer), animations, effects, custom gestures, changing labels and many colors, icon packs, and a bunch of other stuff. Check its <a href="http://novalauncher.com/">website</a> for a full list of features, and download it at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher">Google Play</a>.</p>

<p>Feel free to browse <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=launcher&c=apps">Google Play</a> and try popular launchers, but beware of apps with a hefty download size or questionable permissions. Here are some recommended ones:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher">Nova Launcher</a></b>: easily the best choice. Read above.</li>
	<li><b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.launcher2">Total Launcher</a></b>: highly customizable launcher that claims to be lightweight and easy to use.</li>
	<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=is.shortcut">Evie</a>: a (relatively new) launcher with little customization available focusing on performance, which looks pretty out of the box.</li>
	<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anddoes.launcher">Apex Launcher</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ginlemon.flowerfree">Smart Launcher</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.adw.launcher">ADW Launcher</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/fr.neamar.kiss/">KISS Launcher</a></li>
	<li>Try <b>Zeam Launcher</b> or <b>Hayai Launcher</b> if for some reason you are on old Android with less than 256 mb of RAM.</li>
</ul>
